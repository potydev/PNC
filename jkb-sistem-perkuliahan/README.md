## Key Features

- The system supports soft deletes (deleted_at column) for most entities, allowing for data recovery and historical tracking.
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at) are used across all tables for auditing purposes.
- The structure supports complex relationships between courses, lecturers, and students, allowing for flexible academic management.
- Attendance and journaling systems are tightly integrated with the course and student management aspects of the database.

This database structure provides a robust foundation for managing academic programs, courses, student enrollment, attendance, and related academic activities in a higher education setting.
